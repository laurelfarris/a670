    ``ACOUSTIC WAVES GENERATED BY IMPULSIVE DISTURBANCES IN A
    GRAVITATIONALLY STRATIFIED MEDIUM''\\

% Main topic
There are two well-known oscillations detected from the sun: the five-minute
oscillation period attributed to global pressure modes (or ``p-modes'')
in the solar interior, and the
lesser-known three-minute oscillations in the chromosphere.
Like the interior p-modes, the chromospheric oscillations are thought to
be standing oscillations, waves that are trapped between two nodes from which
they reflect.
In this case, the photosphere and the transition region (TR) between the
chromosphere and corona would be such reflecting nodes. However, signatures
of these oscillations have been detected in the low corona, indicating that
they are able to propagate through the TR\@.
In this study, the authors
investigate an alternative explanation to the idea that the cutoff frequency
at the temperature minimum can explain the three-minutes oscillations, since
it doesn't explain why
frequencies just above the cutoff are largly evanescent.
They suggest that the medium through which the waves are
travelling manifests its response to some type of excitation
%(such as a flare or coronal mass ejection (CME))
in the form of the waves that are then observed. This excitation would have
to be a continuous supply of energy and have the result that
$k \ll \omega_0/C_s$ (where $k$ is the wavenumber, $\omega_0$ is the cutoff
oscillation frequency, and $C_s$ is the sound speed), which gives frequencies around
the cutoff.
